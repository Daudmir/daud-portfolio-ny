My name is Daud Khalid Mir, I am 22 years old and currently studying as an multimedia designer in Zealand in KÃ¸ge. I previously studied at Albertslund high school on the HTX line. Through my IT understanding, I can contribute a whole lot. I am a structured and ambitious person with flair for detail. 

My strength is to combine professional knowledge and experience with the specific interests and needs.
