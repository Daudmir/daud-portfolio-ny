# Description
The meaning of this project was to develop and create a WordPress webshop through the local server, by using WP features while adding custom code through Visual Studio Code. This would then give me the possibility to cusomize the webshop even more, using styling. On top of this we designed the posters ourselfs as well as creating a marketing & SoMe strategy and much more.

Through WordPress, you can implement and manage websites, whcih is a free, open-source content management system (CMS). They are responsible for both front-end and back-end development â€” everything from plug-ins to security updates.
