The meaning of this project, was to develop an invoice management SPA SaaS web application, to help businesses manage their invoices for their clients as well as to send invoices and payment requests.

An SPA SaaS web application is a single-page web application also including a sotware as a service that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages.
