# Description

In this project we are talking about a bakery called Diget and how we ce can create a new visual identity, create a marketing campaign and develop a website that harmonizes with the bakery's new owners and target group, which solves their overall need for a new identity, and desire to implement a take-away solution on their website. Here we have used design thinking which is a tool that I used to understand the users, redefine problems and create innovative solutions for prototyping and testing.


### Solved problems for the bakery

1. How can I develop an ordering system for the bakery, so their customers will be able to order their food at home?

2. How do I enable the bakery to get notified about new orders?

3. How can I simplify the customer's buying process?

4. How can I enhance the bakery's digital presence using a strong SoMe and marketing strategy?

5. How can I improve the bakery's visual identity?
